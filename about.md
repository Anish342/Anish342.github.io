**Welcome to my Website!**

I'm Anish, currently pursuing my Master's in Machine Learning at <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae" target = "_blank"> MBZUAI</a>.  I hold an undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Computing and Engineering Science from the <a href="https://www.iith.ac.in" target = "_blank">Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Hyderabad</a>.

I focus on applied ML for quantitative modelling such as forecasting, time-series analysis, and building agent-based systems that automate multiple stages of a workflow. I’m interested in intelligent pipelines that can process information, assess relevance, and surface actionable signals in real time.

**Research Interests:**
* Quantitative ML (Forecasting, Time-Series)
* Agent-Based Analytical Automation
* Signal Extraction & Decision Systems

**Personal Interests:**  
* I enjoy playing basketball, and have been to national level competitions.
* Love to do mental arthmetic for fun.

**Welcome to my Website!**

I'm Anish, currently pursuing my Master's in Machine Learning at <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae" target = "_blank"> MBZUAI</a>.  I hold an undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Computing and Engineering Science from the <a href="https://www.iith.ac.in" target = "_blank">Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Hyderabad</a>.

I focus on applied ML for quantitative modelling such as forecasting, time-series analysis, and building agent-based systems that automate the early stages of a quant/analyst workflow. I’m interested in intelligent pipelines that can process information, assess relevance, and surface actionable signals in real time.

**Research Interests:**
* Quantitative ML (Forecasting, Time-Series)
* Agent-Based Analytical Automation
* Signal Extraction & Decision Systems

**Personal Interests:**  
* I enjoy playing basketball, and have been to national level competitions and secured 4th place twice.
* Part of the Volleyball and Basketball team at MBZUAI and IIT Hyderabad.
* I also have a passion for music, delighting in both the experience of listening and the excitement of exploring new genres and discovering fresh tracks to add to my playlist.
